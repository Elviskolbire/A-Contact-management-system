Contact Management System
    This project is a contact management system designed to help users efficiently organize and manage their contacts. It allows users to add, view, edit, and delete contacts through a simple command line interface. The program saves contact information to a file, ensuring that data is retained between sessions.
    The primary benefit of this program is to provide a straightforward way to manage contact information. Users can maintain an organized contact list and access it easily, even after restarting the program.
    Features:                    Contact Management: Add, view, edit, and delete contacts.                 Data Persistence: Contacts are saved to a file for persistent storage across sessions.  Backup File: Includes functionality for creating backup files to prevent data loss.Email Validation: Validates email addresses to ensure proper format.                          Class header file: Uses an imported header to define and manage the contact class and its associated methods.
    The program operates as follows:   Data Storage: Contacts are stored in a file. The file is read when the program starts and updated when new contacts are added or existing ones are modified.                          Backup Functionality: A backup file is created to safeguard against data los   Email Validation: Validates email addresses using an algorithm to ensure correct formatting.
    Class header file: An imported header file defines the Contact class, which handles contact information and related methods. This header is crucial for managing the contact data and interactions.
    Technologies Used.               C++: The programming language used for implementing the core functionality.    File ðŸ“‚I/O:  For saving and retrieving contact data to and from files.Command Line Interface: Provides the user interface for interacting with the application.                   contact_h: The module used to define and manage the Contact class and related methods. Contains the implementation of the contact class attributes and a construtor with three parameters 
    Challenges and Solutions:  Persistent Data Loss: Initially, contacts were sometimes lost after restarting the program. This issue was resolved by improving file handling and implementing a backup file to ensure data integrity.                     Email Validation: Faced challenges with validating email addresses. To address this, assistance from AI was sought to correctly implement and test email validation logic.
    Future Plans.                    Add Graphical User Interface: To enhance user experience and provide a more intuitive interaction.             Enhance Error Handling: Improve the program's robustness by handling additional edge cases and errors.
